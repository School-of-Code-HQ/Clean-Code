## Introduction

Well formatted code makes it easier to read and make errors more obvious. Code that is easy to read is easier to understand by you as well as other developers.\
It should be self-explanatory, easy to understand and easy to change or extend.

In this article, we will look at how and why code formatting is important.


## **Naming Conventions**

### Always use meaningful and descriptive names for variables and functions.

**Bad:**

**Good:**

![variable_not_on_line](images/namingCodeGood.png)

## **Indentation-And-Spacing**

Always remember code is read more than they are written. Your code will run without indentation and spacing but it does makes your code easier to read and can help with finding errors in your code easier.

Below are some examples of how indentation and spacing is used with JavaScript. (CHECK WORDING)

### Variables
Variables should always start on the same line.

**Bad Indentation:**

![variable_not_on_line](images/variableNewLine.png)

**Good Indentation:**

![variable_not_on_line](images/variableOnsameLine.png)

### Functions
Also functions of the same level should alwasys start on the same line and keep spacing constant when writing code.

**Bad Indentation:**

![variable_not_on_line](images/adIndentation%20funtion.png)

**Good Indentation:**

![variable_not_on_line](images/goodIndentationFunction.png)

**Bad Spacing:**

**Good Spacing:**

## **Comments**

### How to leave comments like a pro!

Comments save time, help other developers navigate through your code and help your future self understand what you had written.\ 
This is espically true when you are learning, although less is more when it comes to comments, as good code should be self-documenting.

#### As you can see from the examples below, comment overkill can be overwhelming and take to long to read through and understand.

**Bad:**

**Good:**
